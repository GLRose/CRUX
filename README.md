# What is CRUX? #
Crux is a direct messaging application where you are the focal point of the conversation.

# Are you a content creator? Do you have an online business? Are you searching for employment? #
Crux will be a light weight point to point messaging interface where you can keep track of all your most important conversations. 

# Do you have a link tree or a link based form to access all your social medias and online links? #
Crux will act as an extension of these link based applications. 

# Why not use email instead ? #
Email is cluttered and easy to miss important conversations. Spam wont exist because you wont connect it to anything but yourself. 

# How to use Crux? #
Include it in your links to operate as your own personal contact form for business opportunites or collabs. Embed it in your website for easy access. 

# What Crux is not # 
Crux is not a VOIP standard messaging app or social media platform such as Discord, Twitter, Viber, Whatsapp, etc. It is simply a standard accesible way to contact you directly with no distractions of media. 

# Okay but they still want to email me... #
When someone wants to reach out to you, your email will be routed through the backend and you will recieve a notification through crux that a communication was established through email regarding your specifics.
